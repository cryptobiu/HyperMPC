/**
 * We consider extension fields GF(b^e), where a field element is a polynomial of degree at most e over Zb,
 * and can be represented as an array.
 * We could restrict ourselves to fields with characteristic 2 and represent field elements as integers, where
 * the i-th bit is the i-th coefficient. We assume that the operators + and âˆ— are overloaded for field elements;
 * We need to be able to enumerate field elements in some arbitrary order. For simplicity, we assume that
 * the 0-element is the zero element (neutral of addition), and the 1-element is the one element (neutral of
 * multiplication). Furthermore, we need to sample with uniform distribution in the field.
 * Note: Multiplication table could be pre-computed.
 *
 * We focus on GF(2^8).
