/**
* The Gate class is a software representation of a circuit's gate, that is the structure of the aryhtmetic circuit and not the actuall values assigned.
* It contains a type that performs a logical function on the values of the input wires (input1 and input2)  and assigns
* that value to the output wire for multiplication and addition gates. The gates may also be of type input/output and for these gates
* there is the party attribute that represents the owner.
